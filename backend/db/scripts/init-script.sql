Thats where hydrating skincare products step onto the scene! Hydrating products can be anything, from facial cleansers, to creams, to serums. Applying a hydrator to your skin allows your skin cells to absorb moisture and water, making them swell. Humectants are ideal hydrators in skincare. Humectants are products or ingredients that are structurally designed to attract water molecules from your surroundings. ');

However, there are different types of cleansers that are more ideal for certain types of skin.  The common mistakes people make are using the same product in the morning and at night and not getting a product that is ideal for their skin type, says Dr. Lolis. For example, someone prone to breakouts may use a cleanser with salicylic acid only to find it has a reverse effect. When skin is dried out, it increases oil production, which can only make a breakout more prevalent. The best approach would be to see a dermatologist for a skin assessment and a product recommendation that is most suitable for your skin type.');
